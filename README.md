## Nooby-C

**Work In Progress**

Basically, this is me having fun trying to implement my own **Forth** and **C** compilers fully from scratch, starting with assembly.

Everything is being made for the **AMD64** architecture + **Linux**.

### Directories and Files:

**fun** - misc. small just-for-fun written programs

**asm** - AMD64 assembler in Forth(asm.4th)

**forth** - Forth in assembly(forth.asm) and in Forth itself(forth.4th)

**c** - C compiler in Forth(c.4th)

### Current roadmap:
1. Implement **Forth** interpreter in **AMD64** assembly *<-- I'm here*
2. Implement **AMD64** assembler in **Forth**
3. Implement **Forth JIT** compiler in **Forth**
4. Implement **C** compiler in **Forth**
